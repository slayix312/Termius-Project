# Termius Project

This is the Termius Project repository.

## Overview

A comprehensive C++ sample program demonstrating various programming concepts including:

- **Interactive Menu System**: User-friendly navigation through different features
- **Calculator**: Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) with error handling
- **String Utilities**: Text manipulation (uppercase, lowercase, reverse, vowel counting)
- **File Operations**: Reading and writing text files
- **Vector Demo**: Dynamic arrays with statistics (sum, average, min, max, sorting)

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (g++ recommended)
- C++17 or later

### Compilation
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -o termius main.cpp
```

### Running
```bash
./termius
```

## Features

### 1. Calculator
Perform basic arithmetic operations with input validation and error handling (e.g., division by zero protection).

### 2. String Utilities
Analyze and manipulate text strings:
- Display character count
- Convert to uppercase/lowercase
- Reverse strings
- Count vowels

### 3. File Operations
Demonstrate file I/O by:
- Writing user input to a text file
- Reading and displaying file contents

### 4. Vector Demo
Work with C++ vectors:
- Add numbers dynamically
- Calculate statistics (sum, average, min, max)
- Display sorted results

## Educational Purpose

This program serves as a learning resource for:
- C++ syntax and structure
- Standard library usage (`<iostream>`, `<vector>`, `<fstream>`, etc.)
- Error handling and input validation
- Menu-driven program design
- File I/O operations
- Algorithm usage (sorting, transformations)
